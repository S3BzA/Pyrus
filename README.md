# Pyrus
A selection of niche utility python scripts that accomplish specific tasks through CLI. Intended to provide a demonstration on what is achievable using python and its many libraries in an educational capacity.

## Why?
Pyrus is a collection of Python scripts that are developed and maintained with the idea being "How far can we push Python's usefulness?"

To this end, each script may likely not be generally useful, but hopefully really good at achieving one specific task really well. The goal of this project is simply to tinker and find out what is possible with this language.

## Current Scripts

1. palettizer.py - A script that takes in an image and recolours it according to a provided colour palette (Still in development).

## Setup

For now, it should be sufficient to just run the setup.py or use pip in conjunction with the config/requirements.txt (to install the required packages). Either method is done by doing the following, respectively:

`python setup.py install`
or
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
